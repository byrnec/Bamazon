## Purpose of the game

This is a command line app
* Download these files
* Run npm init or npm install in your terminal
* Open Terminal or Git Bash* and type `node app.js`
* Follow the prompts in the terminal
* Configure password of your choice

<!-- Include screenshots (or a video) of typical user flows through your application (for the customer and if relevant the manager/supervisor). This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection (for the different selection options).
Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers/other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works. 
Because screenshots (and well-written READMEs) are extremely important in the context of GitHub, this will be part of the grading. -->
